# Notices

- `@sportsdataverse/sdvplot` re-shards the team index curated in **sdvplot** (Python, MIT) and reads the
  SportsDataverse logo archive manifest. It ports WCAG contrast helpers from **sdvplotR** (MIT).
- `@sportsdataverse/sdvplot` ships NFL data derived from **nflverse-data** by the nflverse project
  (https://github.com/nflverse/nflverse-data), licensed CC BY 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) and
  provided as is, without warranties. The gsis-id map behind `loadGsis()` keeps three columns (`gsis_id`, `espn_id`,
  `headshot`) of the `players` release's `players.parquet`; it holds headshot URLs, not images. The 32 NFL team colors
  (`color_source` `"nflverse"`) and the `nflverse` abbreviation aliases come, through the sdvplot index, from the
  `teams` release's `teams_colors_logos.csv`. Both were modified: columns selected and rows re-keyed.
- `@sportsdataverse/sdvplot/bins` (re-exported by `@sportsdataverse/sdvplot/shots`): `hexbin` and `hexagonPath` port
  **d3-hexbin** 0.2.2, Copyright Mike Bostock, 2012-2016, BSD-3-Clause; the licence text follows this list verbatim.
  `squarebin`, `squarePath`, `binner`, `cellPath` and `cellPoints` are this package's own.
- `@sportsdataverse/sdvplot/shots` ports blazing-the-nets' shot-chart code (Copyright (c) 2021-2026 Saiem Gilani, MIT).
  `diffScale` ports colour interpolation from **d3-interpolate** 3.0.1 (Copyright 2010-2021 Mike Bostock, ISC) and
  **d3-scale-chromatic** 3.1.0 (Copyright 2010-2024 Mike Bostock, ISC), whose RdBu scheme is from **ColorBrewer**
  (Copyright 2002 Cynthia Brewer, Mark Harrower, and The Pennsylvania State University, Apache License 2.0);
  `sizeCells` ports `quantile` from **d3-array** 3.2.4 (Copyright 2010-2023 Mike Bostock, ISC). The ISC permission
  notice and ColorBrewer's licence notice follow this list verbatim.
